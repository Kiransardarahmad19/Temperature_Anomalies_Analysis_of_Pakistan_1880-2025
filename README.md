# Data Analysis Project

A concise overview of the analysis contained in **`main.ipynb`**. This README is a basic starting point; we‚Äôll expand it into a full narrative in the next steps.

## üìÅ Repository Contents
- `main.ipynb` ‚Äî Jupyter notebook with code, visuals, and findings.
- `README.md` ‚Äî You are here.

## üéØ Objective
Summarize the dataset, explore patterns, visualize key insights, and document methods and results reproducibly.

## üîß Environment & Dependencies
Recommended Python ‚â• 3.9. Key libraries used in the notebook:
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`
- `cartopy`
- `prophet`

> Tip: create and activate a virtual environment, then install packages.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -U pip
# Add your libs, e.g.:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly
```
*(We‚Äôll generate an exact `requirements.txt` in the next pass.)*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone or download this project.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab  # or jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run cells top-to-bottom to reproduce figures and results.

## üß† Notebook At-a-Glance
- **Code cells:** 35
- **Markdown cells:** 30
- **Kernel:** .venv (3.13.5)

## üìä What‚Äôs Inside (high level)
- Data loading & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of trends, distributions, and relationships
- (Optional) Feature engineering / modeling (if included)
- Results & key takeaways

## üìå Next Steps (for the detailed README)
- Add dataset description (source, size, fields, time span)
- Document preprocessing steps and rationale
- Showcase top visual insights with captions
- Summarize modeling approach and metrics (if applicable)
- Discuss limitations and future work
- Export figures to `/figures` and reference them
